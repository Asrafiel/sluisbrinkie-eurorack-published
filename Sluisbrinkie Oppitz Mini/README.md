# Sluisbrinkie Oppitz Mini

The Oppitz Mini (named after a German Scientist) is the smaller brother of the Oppitz module. It is a 4HP, 3-channel Mixer and Output Module. It takes 3 mono audio signals and drives a line out and headphone out. The schematic can be found in this directory.

I use this module in my mini workbench case (which is only 34HP wide) because it is extremely tiny and it is great to test new modules with!

Overview of connections:

- 3x Mono Audio In (AC-coupled)
- 1x Headphones Out
- 1x Line Out

In case you bought a PCB (with assembled SMD components) and panel from me, there are a number of things you need to finish the build:

- 3x Thonkiconn mono jacks
- 2x Thonkiconn stereo jack
- 3x 50kOhm Type A potentiometer (Bourns PVT09 series are used in my personal builds)
- 6x potentiometer knobs
- 1x 2x5 pinheader (for eurorack power supply)
- 1x 10-pins ribbon cable (for eurorack power supply)
