This eurorack case file is an adaptation of the work of KevinKeWang: https://github.com/KevinKeWang/tiny_rack
His model unfortunately was too big to print on the 3D printer that I have access to, so I adapted it and slimmed it down. 
It lost a few HP (went from 42 to 39) and also the maximum depth is less than the original. It is now max 50mm on the bottom row and max 40mm on the top row.

In the picture, the back panel is a bit curved (which is where the hotbed was) and you can see where it paused (it had too, because it would trigger the motion sensor and therefore the alarm :P), 
this is also printed at low-quality and 200% speed... And it still took about 40~50 hours xD
