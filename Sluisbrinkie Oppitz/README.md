# Sluisbrinkie Oppitz

The Oppitz (named after a German Scientist) is a 6HP, 2-channel Stereo Mixer and Output Module. It takes 2 stereo audio signals and mixes it to an output that is powerfull enough to drive both a line input and a headphone. It also has a stereo FX insert. The schematic can be found in this directory.

Overview of connections:

- 4x Audio In (AC-coupled)
- 1x Headphone/Line Out

In case you bought a PCB (with assembled SMD components) and panel from me, there are a number of things you need to finish the build:

- 8x Thonkiconn mono jacks
- 1x Thonkiconn stereo jack
- 3x 50kOhm Type A potentiometer (Bourns PVT09 series are used in my personal builds)
- 3x potentiometer knobs
- 1x 2x5 pinheader (for eurorack power supply)
- 1x 10-pins ribbon cable (for eurorack power supply)
